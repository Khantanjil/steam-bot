# steam-bot
This is my first program i have created.


To use my files donwload first the node.js https://nodejs.org/en/

And use the text editor to write the code, i have used the sublime text 3 https://www.sublimetext.com/3

Create a folder on desktop and past the files and rename the folder to "SteamBot"

And when u pasted the files on folder go to the cmd with administrator and go cd/users/youraccount/desktop/SteamBot

And u write that command:   npm install steam-user

When you finalyze the donwload  go to the file "config.json" and edit to your username and password and save, dont forget to open with sublime text 3

And save it and go cmd and write node steam.js
